## Introduction

Software is becoming more and more important in our daily world, helping us throughout our whole activities. Nowadays, some activities wouldn't be possible without it and it will become even more essential to other parts of our lifes. People should be part of the decision of how such software should operate and what software should be born to make their ideas possible.

## Motivation

People in Mexico often have great creative ideas about how to solve common problems in our country. We believe this repository will become a source of collective citizen participation.

## Detailed design

With the collective ideas for software projects, people will be part of new ideas about how to impact our world and to make it a better place for everybody. Citizens, organizations, institutions, professionals, students, designers, analysts, developers, etc. are welcome to contribute.

## Proposed solution

This template must be used to make software proposals, in order to have the repository organized. Each proposal must have all sections and details specified here. When a proposal becomes accepted, further work will start to bring that proposal to reality.
The accepted proposal will be developed in a new repository.

## Impact

We believe that ultimately software will define much of our world and our life and we want to empower people to decide that.

## Future directions

When proposals become reality, we want to make them public so they could be used by the public.

## Alternatives considered

So far there are no alternatives ideas, but they are welcome.
